# React Counter Practice

This is a simple React practice project where you can increment and decrement a counter. The project demonstrates the following concepts:

- Componentization: Splitting the logic between `App` and `ShowCount` components.
- Props: Passing the counter value from the parent to the child component.
- State Management: Using `useState` to handle the counter value dynamically.
- CSS Modules: Each component has its own CSS for styling.

The app displays the message: "You clicked here {count} time", and updates dynamically as you click the "Sumar" or "Restar" buttons.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Run the development server with `npm run dev`.

## Features

- Dynamic counter updates.
- Clean and modular folder structure.
- Simple and reusable React components.
